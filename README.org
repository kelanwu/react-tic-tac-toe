This project is my personal solution to the further practice of [[https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html][React's tic-tac-toe tutorial]].

Here are the improvements listed in order of increasing difficulty:
1. [X] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. [X] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. [X] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. [X] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
